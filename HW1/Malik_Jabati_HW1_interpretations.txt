**1B**

Exposure to SP500 dividend yield has the highest variation (0.1287) and exposure to 10yr-2yr US Treasury spread has the lowest variation (0.0016). Stocks have very different amounts of exposure to SP500 dividend yield and a relatively constant amount of exposure to the 10yr-2yr spread. Exposure to the US 10yr Treasury yield is strongly negatively correlated with exposure to the 10yr-2yr spread (r= -0.8619). Exposure to the 10yr yield has a moderately strong positive correlation with exposure to SP500 dividend yields (r= 0.5914). There is virtually no correlation between exposure to the 10yr yield and exposure to the percentage change in industrial production (r= 0.0165). There is a moderately strong negative correlation between exposure to the 10yr-2yr spread and SP500 dividend yields (r= -0.6291). There is a weak negative correlation between exposure to the 10yr-2yr spread and percent change in industrial production (r= -0.2158). There is a moderately strong positive correlation between exposure to SP500 dividend yields and change in industrial production (r= 0.6508).

Each of the betas has a median near zero (ranging from -0.0006 to 0.1). Exposure to SP500 has the largest range (-2.7 to 6.7) and greatest magnitude for both its min and max. Exposure to 10yr Treasury has the next largest range (-1.4 to 1.7), and exposure to percent change in industrial production has the third largest range (-0.22 to 1.3). Exposure to the 10yr-2yr spread has the smallest range (-0.61 to 0.30).


**1D**

The constant premium (or intercept) has a value of 0.0117 and a relatively large t-stat of 23, suggesting this estimate is statistically significant. The premium for exposure to the 10yr spread is positive and has a t-stat of 4, suggesting the estimate is significant. The premium for exposure to the 10yr-2yr spread is positive, but the t-stat is only 2.5, so the estimated premium is likely not significant at the 0.01 significance level. The premium for exposure to SP500 dividend yields is negative and the t-stat is a negative number with relatively large magnitude, so the estimate is significant. This finding suggests that as exposure to SP500 dividend yields increases, we can expect to receive less return. The premium for exposure to percentage change in industrial production is the largest at 0.1150 and has a large t-stat, so this estimate is significant.

**2D**

All the lambdas vary over time and experience relatively frequent upward and downward swings. The factor premium of the intercept appears to range from -0.25 to 0.25 but shows no strong time trend and has an average near zero. The factor premium for the US 10yr Treasury yield appears to range from -7.5 to 7.5 but shows no strong time trend and has an average near zero. The factor premium for the 10yr-2yr spread appears to range from -2 to 4, but this premium DOES seem to show a downward trend over time; however, it still maintains an average near zero. The factor premium for the SP500 dividend yield appears to range from -2 to 2 but shows no strong time trend and has an average near zero. The factor premium for the percent change in industrial production appears to range from -10 to 10 but shows no strong time trend and has an average near zero.


**2F**

The estimated values of the premia are the same as in the standard two-pass estimation, so see 1D for the premia values. The difference occurs in the t-stats. The second-pass risk premium estimator of the Fama-MacBeth model is influenced by the estimation error of the first-pass betas. The magnitude of the t-stats for each lambda in this model is dramatically smaller, ranging from 0.18 to 1.1. This suggests that none of the premia estimates are statistically significant. From this, one can reasonably conclude that the four macro factors in our model do not meaningfully impact stock returns.
