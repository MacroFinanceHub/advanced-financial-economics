%In all 4 portfolios, the weights decreased by 0.0338% for every asset
%except for the four assets on which we had views -- WTI Crude Oil, Brent
%Crude, and the Precious Metals (i.e., Gold and Silver). In Portfolio 1, 
%View 1a was an absolute view that set Gold returns equal to their historical
%average, View 1b was an absolute view that set Silver returns equal to
%their historical average, and View 2 was a relative view that set Brent
%Crude outperforming WTI Crude Oil by 1 percentage point. Uncertainty was
%set to the variance of assets as per equation 39 of Walters (2014), with
%tau equal to 1/(T-k) as the best quadratic unbiased estimator. Portfolio 2
%was a repeat of Portfolio 1, but set the uncertainty of the second view to be 
%twice that of the first view. Portfolio 3 was a repeat of Portfolio 1, but with
%double the risk aversion. Portfolio 1 was a repeat of Portfolio 1, but with 
%virtually no uncertainty in either view, which I set to 0.00000001.
%Assets in the Agriculture sector made up ~15% of the portfolios, Energy
%assets made up ~63%, Industrial Metals assets made up ~11%, Livestock
%assets made up ~7%, and Precious Metals assets made up ~4%. These sector
%weights stayed roughly constant between the portfolios and benchmark.

%For all portfolios, the change in asset weights was relatively small.
%Looking at percentage change is potentially misleading for intra-portfolio
%analysis, but is useful in comparing differences between portfolios.
%The biggest percentage change in weight occured in Portfolio 4, where
%Silver's weight increased by 2.7%. The smallest percentage change in
%weight occured in Portfolios 1 and 3, where WTI Crude Oil's weight
%decreased by only 0.0072%. The specification of the variance, or 
%uncertainty, of the views in Portfolio 1 essentially equally weights
%the investor's views and the market equilibrium weights. By including
%tau in the expression, the posterior estimate of the returns becomes
%independent of tau as well. This seems to be the most common method 
%used in the literature (Walters 2014, p. 14). In Portfolio 1, the weight
%for Silver increased by 0.94%, Gold's weight increased by 0.056%, Brent's
%weight decreased by 0.072%, and WTI's weight decreased by .0072%. Our analysis
%has only partial views, that is views on a subset of the assets, so by using
%a posterior estimate of the variance we will tilt the posterior weights towards
%assets with lower variance (higher precision of the estimated mean) and away from
%assets with higher variance (lower precision of the estimated mean). Thus the 
%existence of the views and the updated covariance will tilt the optimizer towards
%using or not using those assets. This tilt will not be very large if we are working
%with a small value of tau, but it will be measurable. Our views on Brent,
%WTI, and precious metals tilted our optimizer towards and away from those
%assets. In Portfolio 2, the weight for Silver increased by 0.96%, Gold's
%weight increased by 0.058%, Brent's weight decreased by 0.040%, and WTI's
%weight decreased by .030%. The weight of the precious metals increased by
%more in Portfolio 2 than in Portfolio 1, and the weights of Brent and WTI
%decreased by more in Portfolio 1 than in Portfolio 2. This is because the
%uncertainty for View 2 was greater in Portfolio 2 than in Portfolio 1.
%That tilted our optimizer towards the precious metals and away from WTI
%and Brent. In Portfolio 3, the weight for Silver increased by 0.94%, Gold's
%weight increased by 0.056%, Brent's weight decreased by 0.072%, and WTI's
%weight decreased by .0072%. The percentage change in weights for Portfolio
%3 is equal to that of Portfolio 1. The doubling of risk aversion then
%affected every view equally and did not affect our final weighing of
%assets. Traditionally, depending on their risk aversion an investor will 
%hold arbitrary fractions of their wealth in the risk free asset and/or 
%the CAPM market portfolio. All of our assets were risky assets, so the
%risk aversion level did not have any impact (or a non-applicable impact)
%on our holdings in risk free assets. In Portfolio 4, the weight for Silver
%increased by 2.7%, Gold's weight decreased by 0.14%, Brent's weight
%decreased by 0.10%, and WTI's weight increased by .016%. Portfolio had
%virtually no uncertainty in either view. I also set the uncertainty equal
%amongst all views. This affected the tilt of the optimizer and changed our
%weightings from their values in Portfolio 1.
% 
%There are three additional considerations when constructing our Black-Litterman model
%that affects our output portfolio weights.
%[1] The tau used in our calculations was extremely small at 0.00039 (about two orders
%of magnitude smaller than the 0.025 to 0.050 recommended by Black and
%Litterman). Since we often build the known covariance matrix of returns, 
%sigma, from historical data we can use methods from basic statistics to compute
%tau, as tau*sigma is analogous to the standard error. We can also estimate 
%tau based on our confidence in the prior distribution. Note that both of 
%these techniques provide some intuition for selecting a value of tau which
%is closer to 0 than to 1. Black and Litterman (1992), He and Litterman
%(1999) and Idzorek (2005) all indicate that in their calculations
%they used small values of tau, on the order of 0.025 â€“ 0.050
%(Walters 2014, p. 20). Our small tau affected the optimization of our
%Black-Litterman model and decreased the difference in our change in weights because tau
%is a constant of proportionality. A slightly larger tau would likely make for a better model.
%[2] Weights within the portfolios are based on relative views, but there was high
%correlation between the assets because they are all commodities. We would prefer
%less correlation between the assets in our model. Some views may actually be pulling
%the posterior towards the prior, and the investor could strengthen these views, or 
%weaken views which pull the posterior away from the prior. This point may seem 
%non-intuitive. Given that the views are indirectly coupled by the covariance matrix,
%one would expect that the views only push the posterior distribution away from the prior.
%However, because the views can be conflicting, either directly or via the correlations, 
%any individual view can have a net impact pushing the posterior closer to the prior,
%or pushing it further away.
%[3] Variances in omega are unbounded and are low. This affects our confidence and certainty
%of the views. Idzorek's extension would help here, because it provides a method for specifying
%the confidence in the view in terms of a percentage move of the weights on the interval
%from 0% confidence to 100% confidence.
